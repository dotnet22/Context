# BACKGROUND
- This project provides common interface to use various payment gateways

# GOAL
- I want to add new payment library inside @lib folder named "Payments.Cashfree"

# IMPORTANT
- Implementation of libraries must be consistent across all payment gateway libs
- Study the below Cashfree documents before starting the implementation
- Create this library in .NET Standard 2.0, and latest version of C# that is compatible with it.
- Ensure that Cashfree is based on the latest API version, as per my observation, latest version of API is 2025-01-01
- Try to avoid hard coded values if possible in Cashfree
- Document this project in README.md
