# GOALS
- I want to build a page in ReactJS as per the screenshot at @LMS\dashboard.png
- This page has three sections
- First section of the page shows the current semester subjects as cards
- Next section shows the pending submissions of the subject
- Next section shows the test list of the current semester

# Steps
- Property study the attached screenshot of the web page
- Try to figure out component hierarchy/page structure
- Try to understand the purpose of the screen and study the data presented on it
- Try to identity which MUI components will best suite to create the layout and design of the page

# TECHNOLOGY STACK
- ReactJS v19 (only with Typescript)
- Latest version of TypeScript
- MUI components (https://mui.com)
- React Router v7
- Vite to create application (latest)

# IMPORTANT
- Strictly follow the technology stack I mentioned
- Keep reusability in mind
- Follow good coding practises as per the industry standards
- Design shold be pleasing and having good user experience
- The page must use ReactJS components only, not raw HTML
- Create a basic layout and nice navigation to create common look and feel for entire application as I keep adding pages
- Use react router and integrate it with navigation so I can keep adding more pages in future
